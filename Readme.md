Basically this app demonstrates how to :

  1. Store images in a database ..  
  2. Pass Information through intents using bundle...
  3. Setting up a custom list view
  4. Using Implicit Intents to retrieve image data from Gallery / Camera
  
You can help us out in :

  1. Retrieving a image back from database (on basis of a query done in another activity) and populating it to an imageview in yet     another activity.
  2. Suggesting edits/modifiactions in this application ( if any )........
